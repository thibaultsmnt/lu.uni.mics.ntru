\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Through this project we have shown that by couple of optimisation , encryption using the \texttt{NTRU} cryptosystem, can be achieved with acceptable power consumption on an 8-bit AVR micro controller. Such efficiency improvement by code and assembler optimisation can be continued on multiple part of the cryptosystem which could result of making such public key encryption scheme  efficient for such IoT devices.\\
This example of improvement in energy consumption while using asymmetric cryptography on such small device shows that in the near future, security of information communication can be improved for devices that uses micro controller ($i.e.$ IoT devices) finally deleting vulnerabilities of consumers IoT devices.\\ 
	Our implementation took 3990 clock cycles running on a 8-bit micro controller emulator. While the reference code \cite{dai_optimizing_2018} took 1008 clock cycles , which roughly correspond to a factor of 4. Such difference are mainly coming from the fact that rotation of 8-bit controllers are slower. With those result on encryption and decryption clock cycles, estimates on overall power consumption during normal operation that includes asymmetric cryptography can be computed.

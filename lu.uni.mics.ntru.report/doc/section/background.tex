\section{Background}

This sections presents the concepts, methodologies and technologies used to produce the implementation and the test evaluation.

\subsection{NTRU - Closest latice vector problem}

The NTRU algorithm is based on the closest latice vector problem
\subsection{Mask Generating Function}
\subsection{8 bit AVR controller}
\subsection{Performance testing}
